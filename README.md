# Rock a Roll- Digital Games Project (Jogos Digitais)

## Overview

**Roll a Rock** is a game created as a part of the Digital Games course for the 2024.2 semester. Derived from the classic "Roll-a-Ball" Unity tutorial, it adds a new twist by featuring a rock as the main character. The objective is to collect all coins in the environment to escape an infinite loop of misery.

## Game Description

In **Rock a Roll**, you control a rock trapped in an endless cycle. The only way to break free is by collecting all coins scattered throughout the level. But beware, time is ticking, and you’ll need to act fast to avoid being trapped forever!

### Features:
- **Physics-based gameplay:** Move the rock using intuitive controls.
- **Coin Collection:** Collect all the coins in each level to win.
- **Time Pressure:** A timer constantly challenges the player to move quickly.
- **Winning & Game Over Screens:** Enjoy dedicated panels when you win or lose the game.
- **Retry and Menu Options:** Easy restart or menu navigation after each round.

## Controls

- **Movement:** Use the arrow keys or "WASD" to roll the rock.
- **Jump:** Press "Space" to jump and navigate obstacles.

## How to Play

1. Move the rock around the level.
2. Collect all the coins to win.
3. Avoid falling off the edge.
4. If the timer runs out, it's game over.
5. You can retry or return to the main menu from the game over screen.
